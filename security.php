<p><strong>Security Overview</strong></p>
<p>Allied Bank uses a very high level of encryption to protect your transactions and Accounts from unauthorized access. This includes security in terms of hardware and software at our end such as Firewalls, SSL certificates and other security software.</p>
<p>All information that travels between your computer and&nbsp;<strong><em>ITU</em></strong>&nbsp;Internet Banking Server(s) is secured with 128-bit SSL encryption. This means information cannot be read or tempered between any points on Internet. This ensures privacy of your transactions and any other data that travels over Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Username and Password Security</strong></p>
<p>Access to&nbsp;<strong><em>ITU</em></strong>&nbsp;Internet Banking Service is based on a Username and password. This Username and password is chosen by you at the time of registration. You must keep your Username and Password confidential and take steps to prevent unauthorized use of them. You must not tell or disclose them to another person or allow them to be seen by another person (including family or friends). You must not keep a record of them in a way which they can be determined by another person. You must not record them together. You must not select a Password, which represents your birth date or a recognizable part of your name.</p>
<p>ITU Bank may from time to time provide guidelines for ensuring the security of a Password or Username. The guidelines will provide examples only of security measures and will not determine your liability for any unauthorized instruction on your Account.

<p><strong>PIN Based Security</strong></p>
<p>All financials transactions are secured by a 6-digit One Time PIN. You have to enter this PIN whenever you will try to transfer funds or pay bills. You can always regenerate your PIN and change your PIN delivery method from with-in the&nbsp;<strong><em>ITU</em></strong>&nbsp;Internet Banking.</p>

<p>Always update to recent version of the operating system.</p>
<p>Install the latest version on Antivirus</p>
<p>Do not use&nbsp;<strong><em>ITU</em></strong>&nbsp;Internet Banking from a shared PC such as Net-Cafe's etc.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fraudulent Websites and Emails</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>ITU Bank never asks you for your personal information (ITU Username, password, ATM PIN, OTP) through phone calls, web links, SMS, emails and social media. Also, we never call our customers from 111-225-225. Do not share any information to such callers claiming to be from Allied Bank/government/security companies</p>
<p>Protect yourself from fraudulent websites and emails. For example, watch out for copycat Web sites that deliberately use our or Web address very similar to, but not the same as abl.com.pk. The intent is to lure you into clicking onto their Web site and giving your personal information, such as your Username/CNIC and password.</p>
<p>Always check to see that you have typed the correct Web site address before conducting a transaction.</p>
<p>People are usually mislead by fraudulent emails, which give an impression that email was sent out from us thus causing compromise on your security information</p>
<p>Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments coming from unexpected/unknown emails or SMSs.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Be vigilant.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Always subscribe transaction alerts in order to keep an eye on your bank accounts transactions.</p>
<p>In case of any suspicious activity, change your password instantly and contact 24/7 ITU Phone Banking helpline 111-225-225 immediately for support. This helpline is only for receiving customer calls.</p>
